# Hugo source for my site

This is how I created [my website](//vhugo.github.io/) using [Hugo](//gohugo.oi/).

`Hugo Static Site Generator v0.15 BuildDate: 2015-11-26T04:29:00-02:00`


## Getting the entire code

This repository has git submodule of other repositories, to get them all use the following command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vhugo/vhugo.github.io-hugosrc.git vhugo.github.io
```

Note: There is a bitbucket private repository for the draft articles, don't worry, you won't need it to make the project working on your local dev.
