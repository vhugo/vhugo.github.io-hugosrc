# Hugo source for my site

This is how I created [my website](//vhugo.github.io/) using [Hugo](//gohugo.oi/).

`Hugo Static Site Generator v0.19 darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-02-27T11:21:29+01:00`


## Getting the entire code

This repository has git submodule of other repositories, to get them all use the following command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vhugo/vhugo.github.io-hugosrc.git vhugo.github.io
```

Note: There is a bitbucket private repository for the draft articles (unfinished thoughts), but don't worry, you won't need it to make the project work on your local.
