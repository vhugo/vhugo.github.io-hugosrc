## me
I am a problem solver, puzzle lover, husband and a father in the mid-30s 
working as a software developer for 20 years. I was born and raised in Brazil 
and currently enjoying my days with my family in the Netherlands.

I have spent my entire career writing software in several programming languages 
for a few different industries and I will probably continue to do it so for 
some time. You can check my [resume](http://bit.ly/vhugo_resume) or 
[Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/vhugoalves) profile for more information.

## the site

This is a never-ending, working in progress personal website. The idea is to 
have a place on the web where I can quietly share projects' experiences and 
experimentations.

I've created it in 2015 when I discovered [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and 
found a cool theme called [Cocoa](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme). 

At that time, I wanted to add photos, but I didn't know Golang so I created 
a [script in Python](https://github.com/vhugo/hugallery/) to generate the 
albums with Hugo, but now that I know Golang maybe it might be a fun project 
to work on soon.
