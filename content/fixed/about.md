# About me
I'm a software developer over 30 years of age with 15 years of experience,
husband of a really nice gal and father of a lovely and funny little girl.
I was born in Brazil, but recently living and working in the Netherlands.
I can speak fluently Portuguese and English. In case you're interesting in my
professional background, check out my

## About the site
This is a working in progress project, it supposed to a place where I share
ideas and knowledge I gather from other projects and experiments. It was created
with [HUGO](http://gohugo.io/) using the [Cocoa](http://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/)
theme and for photo albums I use this [humble project](https://github.com/vhugo/hugallery/),
another on-going project of mine.
